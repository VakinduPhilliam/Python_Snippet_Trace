# Python_Snippet_Trace
This set of scripts is written to demonstrate the use of the Python trace module to trace or track Python statement execution. The trace module allows you to trace program execution, generate annotated statement coverage listings, print caller/callee relationships and list functions executed during a program run. It can be used in another program or from the command line. Also demonstrated is the use of the ‘timeit’ module to measure execution time of small code snippets. This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has both a Command-Line Interface as well as a callable one. It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution times. Compiled and presented by Vakindu Philliam.
